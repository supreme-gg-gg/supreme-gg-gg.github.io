My name is Jet Chiang. I grew up in Hong Kong and I am now studying at the University of Toronto. I am motivated to seek constant self improvement and personal growth through actively taking on different challenges in engineering, innovation, and leadership. I like learning random stuff and spending most of my time on cool and novel projects. Toronto is one of the birthplaces of artificial intelligence, and I am excited to be part of the impactful research and transformative innovation happening here.

## Interests

I am passionate about machine learning and its growing applications. In particular, cognitive science and neuroscience fascinates me because I am eager to understand how to integrate machine learning with the biological intelligence.

Currently, I am interning as SWE at Savi Finance, a Toronto-based fintech startup focusing on personal finance. Meanwhile, I am MLE at two design teams at UofT in quantitaive finance and neurotechnology. Last summer, I interned as a Software Developer at Ericsson's indoor radio team, where I greatly expanded by knoweldge about telecommunication and software engineering practices.

During the summer of 2025, I will be researching physics-informed ML at the National University of Singapore and interning at another UofT-based fintech startup.

> I love learning through side projects, hackathons (attended 9+ in 2025), and collaborative problem-solving. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea!

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy reading great works of classic literature and philosophy. Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166962144-jet-chiang) for my bookshelf. _This is not up to date becasue I use my own Notion database, which unfortunately is not public._

## Skills

I am proficient in machine learning, data science, full stack development, iOS development, software engineering, and system design engineering. Here are the technologies I am familiar with:
