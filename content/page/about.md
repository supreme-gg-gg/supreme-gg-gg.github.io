My name is Jet Chiang. I like learning random stuff and spending most of my time on cool and novel projects. I devote most of my time to unique and cutting-edge (i.e. werid) ideas, with the vision of building technology that empower human flourishment. I split my time between open-source, academia, and industry in both SWE and applied ML.

## Interests

I am passionate about machine learning and its growing applications in the software world and beyond. I'm also interested in areas like cognitive science, neuroscience, and robotics.

**Currently, I'm working on:**

- Cloud native AI agents on Kubernetes @ Linux Foundation Mentorship, CNCF / Kagent
- Democratizing SLM fine-tuning @ Google Summer of Code with Google DeepMind
- Scientific machine learning in solar cell research @ National University of Singapore

**Previously, I'm part of:**

- Making solar cell physics model 100,000x faster with neural emulation @ National University of Singapore
- Developing agentic financial data extraction from multimodal sources @ Savi Finance
- Building software and tests on indoor radio dots @ Ericsson
- 3 design teams acrosds quant finance, MLE, neurotech @ UofT Engineering

> I love learning through side projects, hackathons (attended 9+ in 2025), and collaborative problem-solving. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea!

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy reading great works of **classic literature and philosophy**.
