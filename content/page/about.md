My name is Jet Chiang. I like learning random stuff and spending most of my time on cool and novel projects. I devote most of my time to unique and cutting-edge (i.e. werid) ideas, with the vision of building technology that empower human flourishment. I split my time between open-source, academia, and industry in both SWE and applied ML.

## Interests

I am passionate about machine learning and its growing applications. In particular, cognitive science and neuroscience fascinates me because I am eager to understand and solve intelligence.

**Currently, I'm working on:**

- Gemma2 text and multimodal fine tuning @ Google DeepMind (GSoC 2025)
- Scientific machine learning in solar cell research @ National University of Singapore
- Decentralized finance @ Carbon Array (UofT Hatchery backed startup)

Previously, I interned as SWE at Ericsson's indoor radio team and Savi Finance's backend engineering team. At UofT, I've worked at 4 design teams across MLE, quant finance, neurotech, and genetics.

> I love learning through side projects, hackathons (attended 9+ in 2025), and collaborative problem-solving. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea!

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy reading great works of **classic literature and philosophy**. Check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166962144-jet-chiang) for my bookshelf. _This is not up to date becasue I use my own Notion database, which unfortunately is not public._

## Skills

I am proficient in machine learning, data science, full stack development, iOS development, software engineering, and system design engineering. Here are the technologies I am familiar with:
