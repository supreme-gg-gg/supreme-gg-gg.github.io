{{< hello-world >}}

I am a first year undergraduate student studying [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) at the University of Toronto. With software engineering internships and machine learning research experience, I am passionate to innovate about ML and its applications in interdisciplinary fields such as fintech and biomedical engineering.

Outside of hackathons, design teams, and personal projects, I enjoy learning and trying random cool stuff and reading classic literature and philosophy.
