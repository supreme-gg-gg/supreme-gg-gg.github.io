{{< hello-world >}}

I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I have experience in various software engineering and machine learning roles at industry, academia, and open-source. I'm excited to innovate about AI and how it can be extended to empower human flourishing and study the universe.

Outside of internships, hackathons, design teams, and personal projects, I enjoy learning and trying random cool stuff and reading classic literature and philosophy.
