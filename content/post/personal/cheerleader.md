**Talking it out is underrated.** Rubber duck debugging and peer programming are time-tested techniques for thinking clearly, catching bugs, and sparking new ideas. But when you’re coding alone, it’s easy to lose that habit — and with it, a lot of momentum. That’s where Cheerleader comes in: a free, open-source VSCode extension that brings an interactive AI coding companion right into your workspace.

Cheerleader is designed to recreate the magic of collaborative thinking — whether that’s by helping you reason through tough bugs, talk through your ideas out loud, or just stay motivated during long sessions. It’s like having a supportive coding buddy always by your side, powered by Copilot and ElevenLabs, ready to debug, brainstorm, teach, or listen whenever you need it.

## Features

* Interactive Avatar – **Reacts** to your mouse, clicks, and drag it around (Live2D + PixiJS)

* Full Voice Interaction – Talk **naturally**, it’s faster than typing and keeps you in flow

* LLM Coding Agent - Access workspace context, ask questions, encourage you to **think**, and take actions in your editor

* Motivation & Wellness Nudges – Real-time encouragement based on your **workspace** activity, plus gentle reminders to stop brainrotting, take a shower, take breaks, or touch grass

## The Story

Our story begun when James suggested how we can build a rubber duck debugger that help you to pause, reflect, and stay grounded instead of just vibe code your way through challenges. Except in this case, the duck could talk back and high-five you when your tests finally pass. 

From crafting a unique avatar UI to tapping into the latest LLM capabilities through the VSCode API, we’re building a coding companion with charm — one that listens, celebrates your small wins, and gives you a nudge when you hit a wall. 

> Because we believe programming should be powerful and delightful — not isolating, and definitely not a chore.

Search for "Cheerleader" in the VSCode Marketplace to install the extension. (You need a free ElevenLabs API key to use the voice feature).
