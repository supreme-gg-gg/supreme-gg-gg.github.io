Ever gone on LinkedIn and all you saw was “I’m happy to share that I will be working at `{Google, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, etc}` this summer”. You probably thought to yourself, “Wow, I really have to start working harder.” That feeling – the urge to level up your own productivity – is a powerful motivator. We recognized this common experience and decided to harness it.

Chi, Nicholas, Dylan, and I built TaskForce, a desktop productivity app where you can **create and join study sessions with your friends to roast each other and brag about locking in with GenAI and system-tracking informed analytics in real time!!**
