As the final design project of my Praxis II course, I worked with the Toronto Bonsai Society to develop **Bonsense**, an iOS application that helps bonsai beginners monitor the moisture levels of their plants using computer vision and IoT sensor. We hope that this can make the art of bonsai more accessible to everyone.

Bonsai soil, characterized by its composition of aggregate rocks and limited organic matter, presents unique moisture retention challenges compared to regular soil. This project, a collaboration with the **Toronto Bonsai Society** as part of the Engineering Science Praxis II course at the **University of Toronto**, addresses the difficulty beginners face in intuitively determining optimal watering times. We introduce "Bonsense", a user-friendly, accurate, and rapid soil moisture monitoring system. Our solution integrates a mobile application leveraging machine learning with an IoT sensor setup (conductance sensor and Raspberry Pi).

The full features and description is very well written up in my public github repo.
