# My Portfolio

Minimalistic personal portfolio built using Beautiful Hugo theme, with some custom partials and shortcodes for components not natively built-in such as timeline and grid view (feel free to just grab them in `layouts`).

Make sure to have hugo & the theme installed:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
